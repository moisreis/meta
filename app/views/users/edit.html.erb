  # Description: Renders the page for updating an existing User record. It displays the
  #              edit form and incorporates a dedicated, irreversible action section
  #              for deleting the user account and associated data.
  #
  # Usage:: - What: Renders the full view dedicated to editing an existing User record.
  #                It includes the update form and a separate "Danger Zone" for account deletion.
  #         - How: Renders the **_wrapper** for layout, passing the current user's full name as the title.
  #                It uses the **_form** partial for input and a custom **_card** partial.
  #         - Why: Provides the interface necessary to execute the 'Update' and 'Delete'
  #                functions (U and D in CRUD) for the User resource.

<%# Explanation:: This layout wrapper organizes the entire page content into a clean
  #               dashboard structure to ensure consistency; it is used as the main
  #               container and works by setting the page title to the user's full name.

<%= render 'partials/route/dashboard/wrapper',
           page_title: @user.full_name,
           page_desc: "Atualize suas informações pessoais." do %>

  <%# Explanation:: This helper renders the central input structure to modify
    #               existing user details; it is used to save changes and
    #               works by passing the current record and a refresh icon button.
