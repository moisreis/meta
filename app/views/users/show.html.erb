  # Description: Displays a detailed profile page for a specific user, consolidating all account and activity data.
  #              The page uses several partials to structure the content into sections for account information,

  # Usage:: - What: Renders the user's comprehensive profile view within the dashboard layout.
  #         - How: This partial is rendered from the **UsersController#show** action, receiving the **@user** instance variable.
  #         - Why: Provides a single, centralized view for account management, security auditing, and tracking investment activity.
