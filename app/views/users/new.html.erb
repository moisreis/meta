  #
  # Description: Renders the page dedicated to creating a new User resource. It initializes
  #              a blank User object and displays the required input fields via the
  #              shared form partial.
  #
  # Usage:: - What: Renders the complete view for creating a new User instance.
  #                It is responsible for wrapping the input form within the standard
  #                dashboard layout.
  #         - How: Renders the **_wrapper** for the page layout, setting the title and
  #                description, then delegates to the reusable **_form** partial.
  #         - Why: Provides the interface necessary to execute the 'Create' function
  #                (C in CRUD) for the User resource using a consistent UI structure.

<%# Explanation:: This layout wrapper organizes the entire page content into a clean
  #               dashboard structure to ensure consistency; it is used as the main
  #               container and works by setting the page title and descriptive labels.

<%= render 'partials/route/dashboard/wrapper',
           page_title: "Criar usuário",
           page_desc: "Gerencie a criação de novos usuários." do

  <%# Explanation:: This helper renders the central input structure to capture new
    #               user details from the user; it is used to initialize a record
    #               and works by passing the model and a customized addition button.

  <%= render "form",
             user: @user,
