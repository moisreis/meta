  # Package: User
  #
  # Description: Renders the page dedicated to creating a new User resource. It initializes
  #              a blank User object and displays the required input fields via the
  #              shared form partial.
  #
  # Usage: - What: Renders the complete view for creating a new User instance.
  #                It is responsible for wrapping the input form within the standard
  #                dashboard layout.
  #        - How: Renders the `_wrapper` for the page layout, setting the title and
  #               description for user creation. It delegates rendering of the input fields
  #               to the reusable `_form` partial, passing the new `@user` object and
  #               the customized "Criar usuário" (Create user) button details.
  #        - Why: Provides the interface necessary to execute the 'Create' function
  #               (C in CRUD) for the User resource using a consistent UI structure.
