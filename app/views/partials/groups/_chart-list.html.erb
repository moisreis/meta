  # Description: Displays a graphical chart within a standardized dashboard container.
  #              It supports various chart types by dynamically calling rendering methods.
  #
  # Usage:: - What: Provides a reusable wrapper for different types of data visualizations.
  #         - How: Renders a **dashboard/chart** container and uses the **send** method
  #                to execute the specified **chart_type** with given data.
  #         - Why: Ensures all charts share a consistent look and feel while allowing
  #                for flexible implementation of bars, lines, or pie charts.
  #
  # Attributes:: - *data_source* - the collection or URL providing the chart data.
  #              - *chart_title* - the heading text displayed above the graphic.
  #              - *chart_type* - the name of the helper method used to draw the chart.
  #              - *chart_options* - a hash of settings for visual customization.

<%# Explanation:: This variable provides a set of optional settings to customize
  #               the chart's appearance; it is used to prevent errors when no
  #               options are sent and works by defaulting to an empty collection.
  %>
<% chart_options ||= {} %>

<%# Explanation:: This block renders the outer container and the specific chart
  #               requested by the user; it is used to generate the visual report
  #               and works by calling a dynamic helper based on the chart type.

<%= render "partials/route/dashboard/chart",
           data_source: data_source,
           chart_title: chart_title do %>

  <%# Explanation:: This specific line executes the method that draws the graphic
    #               on the screen; it is used to remain flexible for any chart
    #               style and works by turning a text name into a functional command.

  <%= send(chart_type, data_source, **chart_options) %>
