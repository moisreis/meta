  # Description: Renders the application logo component.
  #              Uses a simple horizontal flex layout to center the logo visually.
  #              Ensures consistent sizing and accessibility attributes.
  #
  # Usage: - What: Displays the main application logo using the `image_tag` helper.
  #                Maintains proper padding and alignment across layouts.
  #        - How:  Called as a standalone partial or within a header/footer partial.
  #                Adjusts logo source or dimensions by passing new parameters if needed.
  #        - Why:  Centralizes logo markup for consistency and easy updates across the app.
