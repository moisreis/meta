  # Description: Defines the structural wrapper for authentication views.
  #              Uses a four-column grid layout to organize background and content sections.
  #              Provides a flexible layout foundation for login and registration screens.
  #
  # Usage: - What: Wraps authentication-related partials such as backgrounds, forms, and containers.
  #                Serves as the outermost grid layout element for the auth UI.
  #        - How:  Called using `render 'partials/layouts/auth-wrapper' do ... end`
  #                Yields inner content (e.g., background and container blocks) to the grid.
  #        - Why:  Ensures consistent grid-based alignment and visual balance across all auth pages.
