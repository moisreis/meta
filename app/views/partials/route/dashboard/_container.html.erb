  # Partial: _container.html.erb

  # Package: Meta
  #
  # Description: This partial acts as the main layout wrapper for every page.
  #              It organizes the navigation path at the top and ensures
  #              the page title and content follow a clean, aligned structure.
  #
  # Usage:: - What: It is a structural frame that holds the top navigation
  #                 bar and the main content area of the application.
  #         - How: It uses a vertical layout to stack a sticky header over
  #                a scrollable body, providing specific spacing for different
  #                view types like tables or detail pages.
  #         - Why: It keeps the design consistent across the entire app so
  #                users always find titles and search bars in the same place.

<%# Explanation:: This section creates the main vertical column for the page.
  #               It ensures the content takes up the correct amount of
  #               space and hides any messy scrollbars from the view.

  <%# Explanation:: This white background area is the main body of the page.
    #               It contains the large page heading and the primary
    #               content provided by the specific view being rendered.

    <%# Explanation:: This logic chooses the best spacing based on what is shown.
      #               It adjusts the gaps and padding differently for data
      #               tables, detailed forms, or general information.
