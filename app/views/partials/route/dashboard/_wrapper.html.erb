  # Package: Meta
  #
  # Description: This file creates the main structural frame for the dashboard.
  #              It organizes how the sidebar and the main content area fit
  #              together on the screen using a grid system.
  #
  # Usage: - What: This partial acts as a master container that wraps around
  #                different views like forms or tables to keep them organized.
  #        - How: It sets up a large grid layout, places the navigation sidebar
  #               on one side, and leaves a dedicated space for the main content.
  #        - Why: It ensures that every page in the dashboard looks consistent
  #               and follows the same layout rules without repeating code.

<%# Explanation:: This line checks if a specific view type is already set.
  #               If no type is provided, it safely defaults to a form
  #               layout to ensure the page displays correctly.

<%# Explanation:: This block sets the text that appears on the browser tab.
  #               It combines the app name with a specific page title
  #               to help the user identify which section they are visiting.

  <%# Explanation:: This line calls the sidebar menu into the layout.
    #               It places the navigation links on the left side so
    #               the user can move between different app features.

  <%# Explanation:: This block renders the main content area of the screen.
    #               It accepts titles and descriptions and acts as a
