  # Description: Provides the core grid structure for the dashboard views. It combines
  #              the persistent sidebar partial with the main content container and
  #              injects the view-specific content into the defined layout.
  #
  # Usage: - What: Renders the full dashboard layout, encompassing the sidebar
  #                and the main content container, and injects the calling view's
  #                content (via `yield`) into the appropriate structural position.
  #                It defaults the `current_view` variable to "form".
  #        - How: Uses a <main> element with a 16-column grid to position the
  #               sidebar and the container partials. It passes title and description
  #               variables to the container.
  #        - Why: Establishes a uniform and centralized structural wrapper for all
  #               dashboard-level views, promoting consistency and maintainability.

<%# [Configuration] Defines the default view type (e.g., 'form', 'table') if none is passed.
  #                 This variable is passed to the container partial to determine
  #                 specific layout or styling adjustments.
