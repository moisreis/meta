  # Partial: new.html.erb
  # Date: 12/4/2025
  # Author: Moisés Reis
  # Package: Meta
  #
  # Description:: Displays the view required to initiate and create a new
  #               NormativeArticle record. The page uses the dashboard wrapper
  #               and renders the generic NormativeArticle form partial.
  #
  # Usage:: - What: Renders the interface for creating a new normative article.
  #                 This file acts as the primary layout wrapper for the form.
  #         - How: Accessed via the route for creating a new normative article
  #                (e.g., GET /normative_articles/new). Passes the
  #                @normative_article instance variable to the form partial.
  #         - Why: Provides the entry point for defining new regulatory rules
  #                and associating them with investment funds.

<%# Explanation:: This layout wrapper organizes the creation page into a standardized
  #               dashboard view with a specific title and subtitle. It is used as the
  #               outer shell for the page and works by nesting the form within a
  #               consistent visual header and content area.

  <%# Explanation:: This shared partial generates the actual input fields needed to
    #               collect normative data from the user. It appears inside the
    #               wrapper and works by receiving the article model along with
    #               custom labels and icons for the final action button.
