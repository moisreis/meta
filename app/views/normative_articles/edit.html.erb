  #               to keep regulatory information accurate and current.

<%# Explanation:: This layout wrapper organizes the entire page content into a clean
  #               dashboard structure to ensure visual consistency. It identifies
  #               the specific article being edited by its name and provides a
  #               standardized header for the editing environment.

  <%# Explanation:: This shared partial generates the specific input fields for the
    #               normative article to facilitate data modification. It works by
    #               receiving the existing record and setting the action button to
    #               "Update" with a refreshing circular icon.
