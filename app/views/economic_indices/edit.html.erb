<%# Explanation:: This layout wrapper organizes the entire page content into a clean
  #               dashboard structure to ensure visual consistency. It identifies
  #               the specific index being edited by its name and provides a

  <%# Explanation:: This shared partial generates the specific input fields for the
    #               economic index to facilitate data modification. It works by
    #               receiving the existing record and setting the action button to
    #               "Update" with a refreshing circular icon.
