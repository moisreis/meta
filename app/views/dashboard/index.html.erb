  # Description: Displays the logged user's profile summary within the dashboard.
  #              Shows the user's full name and associated role for quick identification.
  #
  # Usage: - What: Renders a simple dashboard view showing the current user's name and role.
  #                Acts as the initial page after login.
  #        - How:  Uses **current_user** helper from **Devise** to access session data.
  #                Fetches **first_name**, **last_name**, and **role** attributes dynamically.
  #        - Why:  Confirms user authentication and personalizes the dashboard interface.
