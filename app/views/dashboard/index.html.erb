  # Description: Wraps the dashboard home view inside the shared wrapper component.
  #              Passes title and description so the layout renders contextual information.
  #
  # Usage: - What: Defines how the dashboard home page appears inside the global UI shell.
  #                Supplies localized metadata such as title and description to the wrapper.
  #        - How:  Calls the **partials/route/dashboard/wrapper** partial and yields content into it.
  #        - Why:  Ensures dashboard pages follow a consistent structure and inherit shared layout behavior.
