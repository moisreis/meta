  # Package: Meta
  #
  # Description: Renders the view for creating a new **InvestmentFund** record, leveraging the
  #              shared form partial to collect all necessary fund data from the user.
  #
  # Usage: - What: Displays the primary interface for initiating the creation of a new investment
  #                fund entry in the database.
  #        - How: Wraps the content in a dashboard layout and renders the shared **_form.html.erb**
  #               partial, passing the new fund object and specific button labels.
  #        - Why: Provides a single, consistent entry point for data input, ensuring that all
  #               newly created fund records adhere to the required schema and validations.

<%# Explanation:: This layout wrapper organizes the entire page content into a clean
  #               dashboard structure to ensure visual consistency. It acts as the
  #               main container by setting the page title and descriptive labels
  #               to guide the user through the registration process.

  <%# Explanation:: This shared partial generates the actual input fields needed to
    #               collect fund data from the user. It appears inside the
    #               wrapper and works by receiving the fund model along with
    #               custom labels and icons for the final submission button.
