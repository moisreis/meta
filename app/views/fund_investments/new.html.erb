  # Package: Meta
  #
  # Description: Displays the view required to initiate and create a new fund allocation record, which links an investment fund to a specific portfolio.
  #              The page utilizes the dashboard wrapper and renders the generic fund investment form partial.
  #
  # Usage: - What: Renders the interface for a user to start creating a new allocation of an investment fund into a portfolio.
  #                This file acts as the primary layout wrapper for the fund allocation form.
  #        - How: Accessed via the route for creating a new fund investment resource (e.g., GET /fund_investments/new).
  #               Passes the `@fund_investment` instance variable to the form partial.
  #        - Why: Provides the entry point for users to define and track the percentage distribution of assets within their portfolios.
