  # Description: Defines the foundational HTML structure and boilerplate for all email content generated by the application mailers.
  #              This layout ensures consistent framing for email messages.
  #
  # Usage: - What: Renders the standard HTML document structure required by email clients (including DOCTYPE, head, and body tags).
  #                It is the container for all specific email content.
  #        - How: Is automatically wrapped around the content of specific mailer view files (e.g., `confirmation_instructions.html.erb`).
  #        - Why: Provides maximum compatibility and a consistent look across various email clients by defining essential metadata and structure.
