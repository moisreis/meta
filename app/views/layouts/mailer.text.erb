  # Date: 11/25/2025
  # Author: Moisés Reis
  # Package: Meta
  #
  # Description: Defines the plain text layout for all emails, ensuring readability in clients that do not render HTML.
  #              This file serves as the fallback format for email content.
  #
  # Usage: - What: Renders the raw text content of an email without any HTML formatting,
  #                serving as the container for the text-only version of the message.
  #        - How: Is automatically wrapped around the content of specific mailer view files (e.g., `confirmation_instructions.text.erb`).
  #        - Why: Guarantees email deliverability and accessibility for all users, especially those using text-only or mobile email clients.
