  # Description: Renders the page for updating an existing Portfolio record. It displays the
  #              edit form and incorporates a separate, irreversible action section for
  #              deleting the entire portfolio and its associated data.
  #
  # Usage:: - What: Renders the full view dedicated to editing an existing Portfolio.
  #                It provides the necessary form for updating attributes and a distinct
  #                "Danger Zone" section for permanently deleting the resource.
  #         - How: Renders the **_wrapper** for layout and uses the **_form** partial for input.
  #         - Why: Provides the interface necessary to execute the 'Update' and 'Delete'
  #                functions (U and D in CRUD) for the Portfolio resource.

<%# Explanation:: This layout wrapper organizes the entire page content into a clean
  #               dashboard structure to ensure consistency; it is used as the main
  #               container and works by setting the page title to the portfolio name.

<%= render 'partials/route/dashboard/wrapper',
           page_title: "Editar #{@portfolio.name}",
           page_desc: "Atualize as informações da carteira conforme necessário." do

  <%# Explanation:: This helper renders the central input structure to modify
    #               existing portfolio details; it is used to save changes and
    #               works by passing the current record and a refresh icon button.
