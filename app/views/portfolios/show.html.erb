  # Package: Portfolio
  #
  # Description: Renders the page for viewing the complete details of a specific Portfolio resource.
  #              It sets the page title dynamically using the portfolio's name and delegates
  #              content rendering to the model's standard partial.
  #
  # Usage: - What: Renders the detailed view of a specific Portfolio object,
  #                serving as the single-record display page.
  #        - How: Renders the `_wrapper` for the main dashboard layout, setting the
  #               page title to the portfolio's name. It uses the implicit render
  #               call to load the corresponding `_portfolio.html.erb` partial,
  #               passing the `@portfolio` object as a local.
  #        - Why: Provides a dedicated, clear page for viewing all associated
  #               information for a single Portfolio record (R in CRUD), minimizing
  #               code in the view by relying on the implicit partial.
