  # Package: Meta
  #
  # Description: Displays the view required to initiate and create a new investment transaction or allocation record.
  #              The page uses the dashboard wrapper and renders the generic transaction form partial.
  #
  # Usage: - What: Renders the interface for a user to start creating a new financial application or transaction.
  #                This file acts as the primary layout wrapper for the transaction form.
  #        - How: Accessed via the route for creating a new application resource (e.g., GET /applications/new).
  #               Passes the `@application` instance variable to the form partial.
  #        - Why: Provides the entry point for users to input new financial data and record new investments or redemptions.
