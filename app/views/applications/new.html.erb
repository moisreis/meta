  # Description: This view provides the user interface for adding a new
  #              application record into the system database.
  #
  # Usage: - What: It serves as the primary page for the application
  #                creation process within the dashboard.
  #        - How: It wraps a standardized form inside a dashboard layout
  #               to maintain a consistent look and feel.
  #        - Why: It separates the creation logic into its own space
  #               to ensure users can focus on entering new data safely.
