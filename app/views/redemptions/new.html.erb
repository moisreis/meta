  #
  # Description: Defines the page structure for the new redemption creation form.
  #              It sets the page title and description and embeds the reusable
  #              redemption form partial for consistent data entry.
  #
  # Usage::  - What: Displays the page where users can input data for a new redemption.
  #                 It provides the context and layout for the creation process.
  #         - How: Uses the 'wrapper' partial to establish the dashboard layout
  #                and then renders the '_form' partial, passing the @redemption object.
  #         - Why: Provides the interface necessary for the user to initiate and
  #                register a new redemption transaction in the system.

<%# Explanation:: This layout wrapper organizes the creation page into a standardized
  #               dashboard view with a specific title and subtitle. It is used as the
  #               outer shell for the page and works by nesting the form within a
  #               consistent visual header and content area.

  <%# Explanation:: This shared partial generates the actual input fields needed to
    #               collect redemption data from the user. It appears inside the
    #               wrapper and works by receiving the redemption model along with
    #               custom labels and icons for the final action button.
