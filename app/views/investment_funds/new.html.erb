  #
  # Description: Renders the view for creating a new **InvestmentFund** record, leveraging the
  #              shared form partial to collect all necessary fund data from the user.
  #
  # Usage: - What: displays the primary interface for initiating the creation of a new investment fund entry in the database
  #        - How: wraps the content in a dashboard layout and renders the shared `_form.html.erb` partial, passing the new fund object and specific button labels
  #        - Why: provides a single, consistent entry point for data input, ensuring that all newly created fund records adhere to the required schema
