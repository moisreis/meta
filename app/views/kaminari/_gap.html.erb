  # Description: Renders a placeholder element to signify that a range of page numbers is truncated.
  #              It is used to shorten the pagination control when the number of total pages is large.
  #
  # Usage: - What: Renders the truncation marker (typically an ellipsis) in the pagination
  #                control area. It acts as a visual placeholder for skipped page numbers.
  #        - How: Renders a `<span>` element with the classes `page gap`. The content
  #               is dynamically fetched via the Rails I18n helper using the Kaminari
  #               truncation key.
  #        - Why: Optimizes the display of pagination controls for large datasets,
  #               preventing the page footer from being overwhelmed by an excessive
  #               number of sequential page links.
