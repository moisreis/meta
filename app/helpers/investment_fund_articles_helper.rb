# @description This helper module provides view-level support for handling and
#              presenting information related to investment fund articles. It
#              centralizes small formatting rules and display utilities so the
#              corresponding views stay cleaner. When referencing other
#              components such as **InvestmentFundArticle** or **InvestmentFundArticlesController**,
#              their names appear in bold.

# Usage:: - *[What]* This code block defines a helper namespace that groups
#           methods used to format, transform, or present investment fund
#           article data in the application's views.
#         - *[How]* It does this by allowing helper methods to be added here,
#           which Rails then includes automatically in the related ERB templates,
#           keeping presentation logic out of the markup.
#         - *[Why]* It needs to be in the app so that display-related behavior
#           for investment fund articles remains organized, DRY, and easy to
#           maintain across multiple view files.
