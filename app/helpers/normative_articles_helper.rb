# @description This helper module provides presentation support for data related
#              to normative articles. It keeps view-level formatting and small
#              transformation routines in one place. When referencing other
#              application components such as **NormativeArticle** or
#              **NormativeArticlesController**, their names appear in bold.

# Usage:: - *[What]* This code block defines a helper namespace used to group
#           utility methods that assist in displaying normative article data
#           inside views.
#         - *[How]* It does this by offering a centralized module where helper
#           methods can be added and automatically made available to the related
#           ERB templates, reducing duplication and keeping markup cleaner.
#         - *[Why]* It needs to be in the app to ensure formatting logic and
#           small presentation-related calculations for normative articles remain
#           organized, DRY, and easy to maintain throughout the interface.
