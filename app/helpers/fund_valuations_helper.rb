# @description This helper module provides presentation support for data related
#              to fund valuations. It centralizes formatting, display routines,
#              and small transformation helpers so the corresponding views stay
#              clean and focused. When referencing other components such as
#              **FundValuation** or **FundValuationsController**, their names
#              appear in bold.
# @category *Model*
#
# Usage:: - *[What]* This code block defines a helper namespace that groups
#           view-level utilities for showing fund valuation information.
#         - *[How]* It does this by allowing helper methods to be declared here
#           and automatically included in related ERB templates, removing clutter
#           from the markup and keeping presentation logic organized.
#         - *[Why]* It needs to be in the app so formatting and display logic for
#           fund valuations remains DRY, consistent, and easy to maintain across
#           the interface.
