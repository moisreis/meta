# Usage:: - *[What]* This code block stores small, reusable functions that simplify the HTML templates, such as formatting numbers or generating UI elements.
#         - *[How]* It defines methods that take data as input, process it (e.g., format a date, calculate a class name), and return the final output for the view.
#         - *[Why]* It keeps the **Views** clean by preventing repeated logic and ensuring a consistent user experience across the entire application.
