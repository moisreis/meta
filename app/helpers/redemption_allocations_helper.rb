# @description This helper module provides view-oriented support for presenting
#              and formatting data related to redemption allocation records.
#              It keeps small presentation rules and transformations in one place.
#              When referencing other parts of the app, such as **Redemption** or
#              **RedemptionAllocation**, their names appear in bold.

#
# Usage:: - *[What]* This code block defines a helper namespace that groups
#           utility methods used to display or format redemption allocation data
#           in views.
#         - *[How]* It does this by allowing helper methods to be added here and
#           automatically included in the corresponding views, keeping ERB
#           templates simpler and more readable.
#         - *[Why]* It needs to be in the app so formatting logic and calculation
#           snippets related to redemption allocations stay centralized, DRY, and
#           easy to maintain instead of being repeated across multiple templates.
